Django Test Extras
==================

**Enhancements for the Django test command and testing utility code.**

**Author:** [Bright Interactive][1].

Adding to your Django Project
=============================

Requires Django 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 or 1.7.

Add `test_extras` to your INSTALLED_APPS. If you are using South make sure
that `south` is before `test_extras` so that the `test` management command
from `test_extras` is used in preference to the one from `south`.

Run "./manage test --help" for help on the new options provided.

Publishing releases to PyPI
===========================

To publish a new version of django-test-extras app to PyPI, set the
`__version__` string in `test_extras/__init__.py`, then run:

    # Run the tests against multiple environments
    tox
    # Publish to PyPI
    ./setup.py publish
    # Tag (change 1.0.0 to the version you are publishing!)
    git tag -a v1.0.0 -m 'version 1.0.0'
    git push --tags

Running the tests
=================

To run the tests against the current environment:

    ./manage.py test

To run the tests against multiple environments, install `tox` using
`pip install tox`, make sure you're not currently in a virtual environment,
then simply run `tox`:

    tox

Changelog
=========

1.1.2
-----
* Allow use with Django 1.7 (note: django-test-extras has not yet been thoroughly tested with Django 1.7)

-----
* Fix data restore in Django 1.5/1.6 in DataPreservingTransactionTestCaseMixin
